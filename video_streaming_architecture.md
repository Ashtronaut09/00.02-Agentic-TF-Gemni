# Video Streaming Platform Architecture

## System Overview
A scalable video streaming platform designed for 10TB content storage, supporting few thousand monthly viewers with global delivery and low-latency streaming.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Content Storage & Processing Layer
- **Primary Storage**: AWS S3 for raw video uploads and processed content
- **Transcoding**: AWS MediaConvert for multi-format video processing
- **Temporary Storage**: S3 staging buckets for upload processing

### 2. Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- **Global Distribution**: AWS CloudFront for worldwide content delivery
- **Edge Locations**: Leverage AWS edge infrastructure for low-latency streaming
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-tier caching for optimized performance

### 3. Application Layer
- **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway for RESTful API endpoints
- **Compute**: AWS Lambda for serverless processing + ECS for persistent services
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer for high availability

### 4. Data Layer
- **User Database**: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) for user management and metadata
- **Analytics Database**: Amazon DynamoDB for real-time analytics and session data
- **Search**: Amazon ElasticSearch for content discovery

### 5. Streaming Infrastructure
- **Video Streaming**: AWS MediaPackage for adaptive bitrate streaming
- **Live Streaming**: AWS MediaLive for real-time streaming capabilities
- **Protocol Support**: HLS, DASH for cross-platform compatibility

### 6. Security & Monitoring
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for user authentication
- **Authorization**: IAM roles and policies for access control
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for system monitoring and alerting
- **Logging**: CloudTrail and application logs for audit compliance

## Data Flow Architecture

### Upload Process
1. User uploads video → S3 staging bucket
2. S3 triggers Lambda for metadata extraction
3. MediaConvert processes video into multiple formats
4. Processed videos stored in S3 distribution bucket
5. Metadata updated in RDS database

### Streaming Process
1. User requests video → API Gateway
2. Authentication via Cognito
3. Video metadata retrieved from RDS
4. CloudFront serves video from nearest edge location
5. Analytics events logged to DynamoDB

## Technology Stack

### Core AWS Services
- **Storage**: S3, EFS
- **Compute**: Lambda, ECS, EC2
- **Database**: RDS (PostgreSQL), DynamoDB
- **Media**: MediaConvert, MediaPackage, MediaLive
- **CDN**: CloudFront
- **Security**: Cognito, IAM, WAF

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure provisioning and management
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline automation

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling
- Lambda auto-scales based on demand
- ECS services with auto-scaling groups
- RDS read replicas for database scaling
- DynamoDB on-demand scaling

### Performance Optimization
- CloudFront caching strategies
- S3 Transfer Acceleration for uploads
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Database connection pooling

## Cost Optimization

### Storage Costs
- S3 Intelligent Tiering for automatic cost optimization
- Lifecycle policies for archiving old content
- CloudFront caching to reduce origin requests

### Compute Costs
- Serverless-first approach with Lambda
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Reserved instances for predictable workloads

## Security Architecture

### Data Protection
- S3 encryption at rest (AES-256)
- SSL/TLS encryption in transit
- VPC isolation for sensitive components

### Access Control
- Cognito user pools for authentication
- IAM roles for service-to-service communication
- Signed URLs for secure content access

### Compliance
- CloudTrail for audit logging
- VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- Data residency controls via S3 bucket policies

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- S3 buckets and basic storage setup
- RDS database for user management
- Basic Lambda functions for API

### Phase 2: Media Processing
- MediaConvert integration for transcoding
- CloudFront CDN setup
- Basic streaming capabilities

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Cost optimization implementations

## Estimated Costs (Monthly)

### Storage & CDN
- S3 (10TB): ~$230/month
- CloudFront (global): ~$150/month

### Compute & Database
- Lambda executions: ~$50/month
- RDS (db.t3.medium): ~$60/month
- MediaConvert: ~$100/month (usage-based)

### Total Estimated: ~$590/month

## Next Steps
