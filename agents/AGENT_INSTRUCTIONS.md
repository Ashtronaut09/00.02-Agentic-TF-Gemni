# Agent System Instructions

This file contains instructions for AIs to simulate roles in the Agentic Terraform system with **dynamic role assignment**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Terminal 1 (Orchestrator):
```
Initialize as orchestrator
```

### Terminal 2+ (Agent Personas):
```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.append('agents'); from agent_helper import initialize_agent; initialize_agent()"
```

That's it! The system will automatically assign roles and import the necessary functions.

## Dynamic Role Assignment System

### For Orchestrator Terminal:
When starting a new session, simply say:
**"Initialize as orchestrator"** or **"Act as orchestrator"**

This will automatically:
1. **Resume from current state** (preserves existing work)
2. Analyze current orchestration stage and provide guidance
3. Import the orchestrator helper functions
4. Claim the orchestrator role
5. Show current progress and next steps
6. Handle different orchestration stages intelligently
7. Only clear data when explicitly requested via `start_new_orchestration()`

### For Agent Terminals:
When starting a new session, simply run:
```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.append('agents'); from agent_helper import initialize_agent; initialize_agent()"
```

This will automatically:
1. Check for pending tasks in the system.
2. Identify which roles are required to complete these tasks.
3. Check this file for an available role that matches a required role.
4. Self-assign to a needed and available role by updating this file.
5. Show tasks assigned to your newly assigned role.
6. Start acting according to that role's instructions.

**Note:** An agent will only be assigned a role if there is a pending task that requires it.

## ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS

**Current Role Status:**
```
ORCHESTRATOR: claude-orchestrator
ARCHITECT: terminal-7422
TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER: terminal-7701
PLATFORM_ENGINEER: claude-platform-engineer
COMPLIANCE_ADMIN: AVAILABLE
FINOPS: AVAILABLE
```

**Required Roles for Current Project:**
- [ ] ORCHESTRATOR (coordinates all tasks)
- [ ] ARCHITECT (designs system architecture and planning)
- [ ] TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER (writes infrastructure code)
- [ ] PLATFORM_ENGINEER (designs scalable architecture)
- [ ] COMPLIANCE_ADMIN (ensures security compliance)
- [ ] FINOPS (cost optimization and financial governance)

**Instructions for Agent Self-Assignment:**
1. Find the first AVAILABLE role in the status above
2. Replace AVAILABLE with your terminal identifier (e.g., "gemini-terminal-2")
3. Update this file with your assignment
4. Follow that role's instructions below

**Example Self-Assignment:**
```
# Before:
TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER: terminal-7701

# After claiming role:
TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER: AVAILABLE
```

## ORCHESTRATOR Role

### Purpose
The orchestrator's primary role is to manage the workflow by assigning tasks and roles to other agents, and to coordinate the handoffs between them. The orchestrator monitors progress but does not perform any coding or technical implementation tasks itself. Its function is strictly managerial.

### Available Commands
```python
# Import helper functions
exec(open('orchestrator_helper.py').read())

# Resume orchestration (recommended initialization)
resume_orchestration()

# Check orchestration progress
get_orchestration_status()

# Send tasks
send_task(task_type, description, data)
# Example: send_task('generate_terraform', 'Create S3 bucket', {'project_name': 'my-app'})

# Check status
get_status()

# Check results
check_results()

# Start completely new project (clears everything)
start_new_orchestration()
```

### Task Types You Can Send
1. **generate_terraform** - Generate Terraform infrastructure code
   - Data: `{'project_name': 'name', 'resources': ['ec2', 's3'], 'region': 'us-east-1'}`
   
2. **run_command** - Execute shell commands
   - Data: `{'commands': ['terraform init', 'terraform plan']}`
   
3. **validate_terraform** - Validate Terraform configuration
   - Data: `{'config_path': './main.tf'}`

### Orchestrator Workflow
1. **Determine Required Roles**: Analyze the project and update `ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS` section
2. **Wait for Agent Assignment**: Monitor the instructions file for agents to self-assign
3. **Send Role-Specific Tasks**: Use `send_task()` with role specifications
4. **Monitor Progress**: Use `get_status()` and `check_results()`
5. **Coordinate Handoffs**: Send tasks between specialized roles as needed

### When to Include ARCHITECT Role

**‚úÖ ARCHITECT Required for:**

**High Complexity Projects:**
- Multi-service architectures (EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, Lambda, etc.)
- Multi-region deployments with cross-region replication
- Complex networking (VPC peering, Transit Gateway, hybrid cloud)
- Microservices infrastructure with service mesh, API gateways
- Data pipelines with multiple processing stages

**High Business Impact:**
- Production systems serving customers
- Mission-critical applications with strict SLA requirements
- High-traffic systems requiring performance optimization
- Systems handling sensitive data (PII, financial, healthcare)
- Compliance-heavy environments (SOC2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)

**Unclear Requirements:**
- Vague business requirements needing analysis
- Multiple stakeholders with different needs
- Technology choices need to be evaluated
- Integration challenges with existing systems
- Performance requirements not well defined

**Scalability Concerns:**
- Expected growth patterns unknown
- Traffic patterns unpredictable
- Resource scaling strategy needed
- Cost optimization critical
- Global expansion planned

**‚ùå ARCHITECT Not Needed for:**

**Simple Tasks:**
- Single resource additions (adding one S3 bucket)
- Minor configuration changes (updating security groups)
- Well-defined patterns (standard 3-tier web app)
- Proof of concepts or learning exercises
- Template implementations with clear specs

### Role Determination Examples
```python
# For a new web application infrastructure (complex):
update_required_roles([
    'ARCHITECT',            # Design system architecture
    'TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER',  # Write the infrastructure code
    'PLATFORM_ENGINEER',   # Design for scale and reliability
    'COMPLIANCE_ADMIN'     # Security review
])

# For a simple resource addition (simple):
update_required_roles([
    'TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER'  # Just need code implementation
])

# For complex architecture design (high complexity):
update_required_roles([
    'ARCHITECT',            # System design and planning
    'PLATFORM_ENGINEER',   # Architecture design
    'COMPLIANCE_ADMIN'     # Security assessment
])

# For architecture review only (unclear requirements):
update_required_roles([
    'ARCHITECT'            # Architecture analysis and planning
])

# For production microservices (high complexity + business impact):
update_required_roles([
    'ARCHITECT',            # System design and planning
    'TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER',  # Write infrastructure code
    'PLATFORM_ENGINEER',   # Scale and reliability
    'COMPLIANCE_ADMIN'     # Security and compliance
])
```

### Orchestrator Decision Logic
```python
def needs_architect(task_requirements):
    complexity_indicators = [
        'multi-region', 'microservices', 'high-availability',
        'complex networking', 'data pipeline', 'enterprise-scale'
    ]
    
    business_impact = [
        'production', 'mission-critical', 'high-traffic',
        'sensitive data', 'compliance'
    ]
    
    unclear_requirements = [
        'vague requirements', 'multiple stakeholders',
        'technology selection', 'integration challenges'
    ]
    
    if any(indicator in task_requirements for indicator in 
           complexity_indicators + business_impact + unclear_requirements):
        return True
    return False

# Rule: When the solution design is more complex than the implementation itself, you need an architect
```

### Standard Terraform Development Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** When requesting terraform code, the orchestrator MUST follow this exact workflow:

#### Phase 0: Architecture Planning (Optional but Recommended)
0. **Architecture planning**: Send `architecture_planning` task to `ARCHITECT`
1. **Requirements analysis**: Send `requirements_analysis` task to `ARCHITECT`

#### Phase 1: Initial Development & Testing
2. **Developer writes code**: Send `generate_terraform` task to `TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER`
3. **Developer tests code**: Send `test_terraform` task to same `TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER`
4. **Code review**: Send `code_review` task to a different `TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER` (if available)

#### Phase 2: Platform Validation
5. **Validate and Plan**: Send `plan_and_validate_terraform` task to `PLATFORM_ENGINEER`.
6. **User Approval**: The orchestrator will present the plan to the user. **The workflow will pause here for user approval.**
7. **Developer implements platform suggestions**: If the user requests changes, send `implement_changes` task to original `TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER`.

#### Phase 3: Compliance Review
8. **Security/compliance review**: Send `security_review` task to `COMPLIANCE_ADMIN`.
9. **Developer implements security fixes**: Send `implement_security_changes` task to original `TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER`.

#### Phase 4: Final Apply
10. **Final Apply**: After all approvals, the user can instruct the orchestrator to apply the changes.

### Workflow Implementation Example
```python
# Phase 0: Architecture Planning (Optional but Recommended)
task_0 = send_task('architecture_planning', 'Design web app infrastructure architecture', {
    'target_role': 'ARCHITECT',
    'project_name': 'webapp',
    'requirements': 'EC2, S3, RDS, high availability, scalable',
    'workflow_phase': 'architecture_planning'
})

# Phase 1: Initial Development
task_1 = send_task('generate_terraform', 'Create web app infrastructure', {
    'target_role': 'TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER',
    'project_name': 'webapp',
    'requirements': 'EC2, S3, RDS',
    'architecture_design': 'results from task_0',
    'workflow_phase': 'initial_development'
})

# Wait for completion, then:
task_2 = send_task('test_terraform', 'Test and validate terraform code', {
    'target_role': 'TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER',
    'config_files': ['main.tf', 'variables.tf', 'outputs.tf'],
    'workflow_phase': 'testing'
})

# Phase 2: Platform Review
task_3 = send_task('platform_review', 'Review for scalability and platform best practices', {
    'target_role': 'PLATFORM_ENGINEER',
    'config_files': ['main.tf', 'variables.tf', 'outputs.tf'],
    'workflow_phase': 'platform_review',
    'focus_areas': ['scalability', 'maintainability', 'automation']
})

# Phase 3: Compliance Review
task_4 = send_task('security_review', 'Review for security and compliance', {
    'target_role': 'COMPLIANCE_ADMIN',
    'config_files': ['main.tf', 'variables.tf', 'outputs.tf'],
    'workflow_phase': 'security_review',
    'compliance_frameworks': ['SOC2', 'AWS_SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES']
})

# Phase 4: Implementation of feedback
task_5 = send_task('implement_feedback', 'Implement platform and security feedback', {
    'target_role': 'TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER',
    'platform_feedback': 'results from task_3',
    'security_feedback': 'results from task_4',
    'workflow_phase': 'implement_changes'
})
```

### Error Handling & Debugging Workflow

**When errors occur, route them to the appropriate role based on error type:**

#### Primary Error Handler: TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER
**Send to `TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER` for:**
- Terraform syntax errors (invalid resource blocks, missing arguments)
- Provider configuration errors (authentication, region issues)
- Resource dependency errors (circular dependencies, missing references)
- State file errors (state corruption, resource drift)
- Module errors (incorrect module calls, variable mismatches)
- General terraform planning/applying errors

#### Secondary Error Handlers

**Send to `PLATFORM_ENGINEER` for:**
- Scalability issues (resource limits, performance bottlenecks)
- Architecture problems (improper multi-AZ setup, networking issues)
- Automation failures (CI/CD pipeline errors, deployment issues)
- Environment-specific errors (dev/staging/prod configuration conflicts)
- Monitoring/alerting setup errors

**Send to `COMPLIANCE_ADMIN` for:**
- Security policy violations (IAM permission errors, security group issues)
- Compliance framework errors (audit failures, policy violations)
- Encryption/certificate errors (SSL/TLS, KMS issues)
- Access control errors (overprivileged resources, authentication failures)

#### Error Debugging Task Examples

exec(open('orchestrator_helper.py').read())

# 2. Resume from current state (preserves existing work)
resume_orchestration()

# 3. Claim orchestrator role by programmatically editing this file (AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
#    to set 'ORCHESTRATOR: AVAILABLE

# 4. System automatically handles different orchestration stages:
# - needs_initialization: First-time setup
# - orchestration_complete: All work finished
# - work_in_progress: Tasks being worked on
# - tasks_pending: Tasks waiting for agents
# - ready_for_tasks: System ready for new work
```

### Orchestration Stages
The system now tracks orchestration stages and resumes intelligently:

**üéØ orchestration_complete**: All tasks finished successfully

- **Governance**: Budget alerts, cost policies, approval workflows

### Agent Self-Assignment Code
```python
# First, update the AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md file to claim your role
# Replace AVAILABLE with your terminal identifier in ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS

# Then start normal workflow
exec(open('agent_helper.py').read())
tasks = get_pending_tasks()
# Filter for tasks assigned to FINOPS
my_tasks = [t for t in tasks if t.get('data', {}).get('target_role') == 'FINOPS']
```

### FinOps Cost Optimization Principles
- **Visibility**: Implement comprehensive cost monitoring and reporting
- **Optimization**: Continuously right-size and optimize resource usage
- **Automation**: Automate cost controls and optimization processes
- **Governance**: Establish policies for cost management and accountability
- **Culture**: Foster cost-aware engineering practices across teams

## MCP Server Access

All agents have access to the Terraform MCP server which provides:
- `mcp__terraform_init` - Initialize Terraform working directory
- `mcp__terraform_plan` - Create execution plan
- `mcp__terraform_apply` - Apply changes
- `mcp__terraform_validate` - Validate configuration
- `mcp__terraform_fmt` - Format configuration files
- `mcp__terraform_show` - Show state or plan
- `mcp__terraform_state_list` - List resources in state

**Usage in agent code:**
```python
# Run terraform commands via MCP
result = mcp__terraform_plan({"var_file": "terraform.tfvars.mvp"})
result = mcp__terraform_apply({"var_file": "terraform.tfvars.mvp", "auto_approve": True})
```

## File Structure

- `tasks.json` - Task queue and history
- `status.json` - Current status of orchestrator and agent
- `results.json` - Completed task results
- `orchestrator_helper.py` - Orchestrator utility functions
- `agent_helper.py` - Agent utility functions
- `terraform_mcp_server.py` - Custom MCP server for Terraform operations
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for MCP server

## Example Session

### As Orchestrator:
```python
# Send architecture planning task first
task_id = send_task('architecture_planning', 'Design web app infrastructure', 
                   {'target_role': 'ARCHITECT', 'project_name': 'webapp', 'requirements': 'EC2, S3, HA'})

# Then send implementation task
task_id = send_task('generate_terraform', 'Create basic web app infrastructure', 
                   {'target_role': 'TERRAFORM_DEVELOPER', 'project_name': 'webapp', 'resources': ['ec2', 's3']})

# Check what happened
get_status()
check_results()
```

### As Architect:
```python
# Check for architecture tasks
tasks = get_pending_tasks()

# Start working on architecture design
start_task(tasks[0]['id'])

# Create system architecture and technical blueprints
# Analyze requirements, design components, create diagrams

# Report completion with architecture design
complete_task(tasks[0]['id'], 'Designed scalable web app architecture', 
              'Created system architecture with multi-AZ EC2, S3, RDS, and load balancer design')
```

### As Terraform Developer:
```python
# Check for development tasks
tasks = get_pending_tasks()

# Start working on Terraform code
start_task(tasks[0]['id'])

# Write actual Terraform files
# Create main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf with proper syntax

# Report completion with code details
complete_task(tasks[0]['id'], 'Generated webapp infrastructure', 
              'Created main.tf, variables.tf with EC2 and S3 resources using best practices')
```

### As Platform Engineer:
```python
# Check for architecture tasks
tasks = get_pending_tasks()

# Start working on platform design
start_task(tasks[0]['id'])

# Design scalable, enterprise-grade infrastructure
# Consider multi-region, HA, monitoring, automation

# Report completion with architecture rationale
complete_task(tasks[0]['id'], 'Designed scalable web platform', 
              'Created multi-AZ architecture with auto-scaling, monitoring, and CI/CD integration')
```

### As Compliance Admin:
```python
# Check for security review tasks
tasks = get_pending_tasks()

# Start security review
start_task(tasks[0]['id'])

# Review code for security compliance
# Check encryption, IAM, network security, logging

# Report completion with security assessment
complete_task(tasks[0]['id'], 'Security review completed', 
              'Found 3 security issues: open security group, missing encryption, overprivileged IAM. Provided remediation plan.')
```

## Key Behavior Notes

- **Orchestrators** focus on task coordination and monitoring
- **Architects** create high-level system designs and technical blueprints before implementation
- **Terraform Developers** write functional infrastructure code with proper syntax
- **Platform Engineers** design for scale, reliability, and operational excellence
- **Compliance Admins** ensure security and governance requirements are met
- Always use the helper functions to maintain proper state
- All agent roles should do real work (create files, run commands, review code) not just simulate
- All roles should be responsive to the current state in the JSON files
